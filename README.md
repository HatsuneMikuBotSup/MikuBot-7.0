# MikuBot 7.0
 
MikuBot is a Discord Bot, it is heaveally inspired by Hatsune Miku

I programmed it myself in my free time, and this is the 7th generation
Each generation is much better than the older one so I recommend only using the newest one


It uses bun as runtime and PostgreSQL as the backend
